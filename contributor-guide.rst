There are plenty of ways to give something back to the open source community.
Following you find a couple of them for JSXC and no matter which you choose,
we appreciate every help.

Report a bug
------------
You found a bug in a stable release of JSXC? Please open a new issue for it
on our `issue tracker <https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/issues>`_. You want to
minimize the number of bugs in stable releases?

twitter to receive notifications about new prereleases.

Please provide the following points in your issue:
- Which jsxc version number do you use?
- In which system do you use jsxc? (e.g. nextcloud, sogo, ...)
- Can you reproduce your issue? If yes, how?
- Which browser and browser version do you use?
- Do you have any browser plugins enabled?
- Do you see any errors in your javascript console (ctrl+shift+I)?

Contribute code
---------------
You find detailed information in our :doc:`developer notes <development/notes>`, but the following steps describes the general process.

#. Fork the corresponding repository
#. Create a local branch for your fix
#. Commit your changes and push your created branch to your fork
#. Open a new pull request into our master branch

A good way to get familiar with JSXC to work on a `starter issue <https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astarter>`_.

Translate JSXC into your language
---------------------------------
JSXC is currently translated into `13 languages <https://webtranslateit.com/en/projects/10365-JSXC/project_locales>`_
and we are always looking for new translators, which add new or complete existing languages. Interested?
